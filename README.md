### Full-Stack Technologies & Tools Breakdown

| Category | Technology/Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core** | **Django** (Python Web Framework) | The primary framework for server-side development, providing the MVC/MTV structure. |
| **API** | **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | Building the RESTful API endpoints that the React frontend communicates with. Essential for decoupling the front-end and back-end. |
| **Language** | **Python** | The primary programming language for the back-end logic. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **SQLite** (for development) | Relational database to store application data. Django's Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) handles interaction with the database. |
| **Authentication** | **Django's built-in Auth System**, **Simple JWT** | Handling user sign-up, login, and secure API access (often with JSON Web Tokens). |
| **CORS** | `django-cors-headers` | A package to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues when the React and Django servers run on different ports/domains. |
| **Real-time** | **Django Channels** | Adding WebSocket and real-time capabilities (e.g., chat) to the application. |

| Category | Technology/Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Version Control** | **Git** / **GitHub/GitLab** | Tracking code changes and collaboration. |
| **Virtual Environment** | **`venv`** / **Pipenv** (Python), **Node.js/npm/yarn** (JavaScript) | Isolating project dependencies for consistent development. |
| **Containerization** | **Docker** / **Docker Compose** | Packaging the application and its dependencies into isolated containers for consistent deployment. |
| **Deployment** | **Heroku**, **AWS**, **DigitalOcean** | Cloud platforms for hosting and running the final application. |
