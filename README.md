### 🌍 About Me

💡 I'm Morest Burawa, a passionate ALX software engineering and Data Sciences student focused on using **data to empower business decisions** that drive growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

🚀 My journey in technology began with curiosity, but quickly evolved into a mission:  
**"Beyond Data Lies Sight to Spark Decisions, Igniting Growth."**

🎯 **My purpose** is to help businesses make informed, strategic decisions through technology and data science. I believe in the **transformative power of hard work**, continuous learning, and using data not just to understand — but to inspire action.

🎓 I’ve successfully completed my **matric** and earned **three consecutive leadership certificates** for excellence in guiding peers and teams. My goal is to **complete my formal studies within the next year** and launch a business that applies data science to real-world challenges.
